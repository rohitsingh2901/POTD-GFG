Does array represent Heap

Given an array arr of size n, the task is to check if the given array can be a level order representation of a Max Heap.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
arr[] = {90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2}
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
The given array represents below tree
       90
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
7    12  2
The tree follows max-heap property as every
node is greater than all of its descendants.
Example 2:
Input:  
n = 6
arr[] = {9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11}
Output:
0
Explanation:
The given array represents below tree
       9
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
7    12  11
The tree doesn't follows max-heap property 9 is
smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11. 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isMaxHeap() which takes the array arr[] and its size n as inputs and returns True if the given array could represent a valid level order representation of a Max Heap, or else, it will return False.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arri ≤ 105


Explanation:

1. Initialization: The function `isMaxHeap` takes two parameters: an integer array `arr[]` representing the heap and an integer `n` representing the size of the array. It initializes the `child` variable to 1, assuming that the array is 0-indexed.

2. Loop: The function iterates over the array using the loop variable `par`, which represents the index of the parent node. The loop continues until the `child` index is less than `n`, ensuring that there are still elements in the array to check.

3. Node Comparison:
   - For each iteration, it checks if the value of the child node at index `child` is greater than the value of its parent node at index `par`. If it is, this violates the Max Heap property, and the function returns `false`.
   - Additionally, it checks if the next child node (if it exists) at index `child + 1` is greater than its parent node at index `par`. If it is, this also violates the Max Heap property, and the function returns `false`.

4. Increment Child Index: After checking both child nodes of the current parent node, the `child` index is incremented by 2 to move to the next pair of child nodes.

5. Return Value: If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means that the array represents a Max Heap, and the function returns `true`.

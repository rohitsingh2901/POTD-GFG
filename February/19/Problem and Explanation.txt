Game with String

Given a string s of lowercase alphabets and a number k, the task is to print the minimum value of the string after removal of k characters. The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of the count of each distinct character present in the string. 

Example 1:

Input: 
s = abccc, k = 1
Output: 
6
Explaination:
We remove c to get the value as 12 + 12 + 22
Example 2:

Input: 
s = aabcbcbcabcc, k = 3
Output: 
27
Explaination: 
We remove two 'c' and one 'b'. Now we get the value as 32 + 32 + 32.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minValue() which takes s and k as input parameters and returns the minimum possible required value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n+klog(p))  where n is the length of string and p is number of distinct alphabets and k number of alphabets to be removed. 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
0 ≤ k ≤ |string length| ≤ 105

Explaination:

1. Map Creation: 
   - You initialize an unordered map to store the frequency of each character in the input string.

2. Character Frequency Counting: 
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - For each character encountered, increment its count in the map.

3. Priority Queue Initialization:
   - You create a priority queue to store frequencies in descending order.

4. Filling Priority Queue:
   - Iterate through the map.
   - For each character-frequency pair, push the frequency into the priority queue.

5. Removing Characters:
   - Loop `k` times.
   - Each iteration:
     - Remove the character with the highest frequency from the priority queue.
     - Decrement its frequency by 1 and push it back into the priority queue.
     - This effectively removes the least frequent characters `k` times.

6. Calculating Sum of Squares:
   - Initialize a variable `ans` to store the sum of squares of frequencies.
   - Iterate through the priority queue.
   - For each frequency:
     - Pop it from the priority queue.
     - Add its square to `ans`.

7. Returning Result:
   - Return the calculated sum of squares (`ans`).

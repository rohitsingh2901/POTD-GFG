Decimal Equivalent of Binary Linked List

Given a singly linked list of length n. The link list represents a binary number, ie- it contains only 0s and 1s. Find its decimal equivalent.
The significance of the bits decreases with the increasing index in the linked list.
An empty linked list is considered to represent the decimal value 0. 

Since the answer can be very large, answer modulo 109+7 should be printed.

Example 1:
Input:
n = 3
Linked List = {0, 1, 1}
Output:
3
Explanation:
0*22 + 1*21 + 1*20 =  1 + 2 + 0 = 3
Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
Linked List = {1, 1, 1, 0}
Output:
14
Explanation:
1*23 + 1*22 + 1*21 + 0*20 =  8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 14
Your Task:
You do not have to take any input or print anything. Complete the function decimalValue() which takes a head node of a linked list as an input parameter and returns decimal representation of it.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 100
Data of each node is either 0 or 1


Explanation:
- Initialize the variable `ans` to 0 to accumulate the decimal value.
- Traverse the linked list and for each node, you multiply the current value of `ans` by 2 (shift left) and add the value of the current node. This effectively builds the decimal representation of the binary number.
- Take modulo 1000000007 after each operation to prevent overflow and keep the result within the specified range.

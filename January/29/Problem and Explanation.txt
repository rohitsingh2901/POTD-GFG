Count digit groupings of a number

Given a string str consisting of digits, you can divide it into sub-groups by separating the string into substrings. For example, "112" can be divided as {"1", "1", "2"}, {"11", "2"}, {"1", "12"}, and {"112"}.

A valid grouping can be done if you are able to divide sub-groups where the sum of digits in a sub-group is less than or equal to the sum of the digits of the sub-group immediately right to it. Your task is to determine the total number of valid groupings that could be done for a given string.

Example 1: 

Input: 
str = "1119"
Output: 
7
Explanation: 
One valid grouping is {"1", "11", "9"}.
Sum of digits of first sub-group ("1") is 1,
for the second sub-group ("11"), it is 2,
and for the third one ("9"), it is 9.
As the sum of digits of the sub-groups is 
in increasing order, it forms a valid grouping.
Other valid grouping are {"1", "119"}, {"1","1","19"}, 
{"1","1","1","9"}, {"11","19"}, {"111","9"} and {"1119"}
are six other valid groupings.
Example 2:

Input: 
str = "12"
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
{"1","2"} and {"12"} are two valid groupings.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function TotalCount() which takes the string str as input parameter and returns total possible groupings.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N3) where N is the length of the string.
Expected Space Complexity: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
stri âˆˆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}


Explanation:

- The "solve" function recursively calculates the number of valid groupings starting from index "i" in the string "s" and having a previous sum of "prev_sum".
- It checks if the result for the current state "(i, prev_sum)" has already been computed. If so, it returns the memoized value.
- Otherwise, it iterates over all possible partition points starting from index "i", updating the sum as it goes.
- If the sum at the current partition point is greater than or equal to the previous sum, it recursively calls "solve" for the next substring and accumulates the result.
- Finally, it memoizes and returns the result.

The "TotalCount" function initializes the memoization array "dp" and calls the "solve" function with initial parameters.

This implementation effectively computes the total number of valid groupings for the given string.

The complexity of this solution is also O(N^3), where N is the length of the string. Although it's implemented recursively, memoization ensures that each state "(i, prev_sum)" is computed only once.

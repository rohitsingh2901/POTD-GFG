Longest subarray with sum divisible by K

Given an array arr containing N integers and a positive integer K, find the length of the longest sub array with sum of the elements divisible by the given value K.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6, K = 3
arr[] = {2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5}
Output: 
4
Explanation:
The subarray is {7, 6, 1, 4} with sum 18, which is divisible by 3.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7, K = 3
arr[] = {-2, 2, -5, 12, -11, -1, 7}
Output: 
5
Explanation:
The subarray is {2,-5,12,-11,-1} with sum -3, which is divisible by 3.
Your Task:
The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function longSubarrWthSumDivByK() that takes an array arr, sizeOfArray n and a  positive integer K, and returns the length of the longest subarray which has sum divisible by K. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= K <= 109
-109 <= A[i] <= 109 


Explanation:

if s1 = aK+ r1 and s2 = bK+ r2
then  s1- s2 = (a-b)K  => (s1-s2) is divisible by K
we will store prefix sum, prefix sum remainder with K and check the above condition
if satisfied will store its length
